Thekla is a Screenplay Pattern Implementation implemented in Typescript and using WebdriverJS as the browser driver.
If you want to know more about the Screenplay Pattern check out
[The Screenplay Pattern explained by the Serenity creators](https://serenity-js.org/design/screenplay-pattern.html).

I started thekla as a pet project to understand the basic principles of the Screenplay Pattern without the need to use
protractor, as it dit not provide the possibility to write browser interaction test between different browsers like
Firefox and Chrome.
