# Getting Started

The following pages will guide you through the first steps of installing and configuring thekla 
as well as writing your first test case.

For the sake of simplicity I will demonstrate it by using [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), 
a bdd testing framework. 

You could also use [Cucumber.js](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/javascript/), 
again a BDD testing framework but with the focus on readability and ease of use without deep technical knowledge.

If you have any questions or problems using thekla contact me on [github](https://github.com/andy-schulz/thekla/issues/new).
